# Tasks

### Task 1: Lock-ins

In this week's course material, you might have heard about concept of lock-ins, often differentiated into **technological** and **vendor lock-ins**. Provide a brief summary of each type of lock-in. Feel free to share any personal insights you may have regarding your own experiences with these lock-ins. Additionally, discuss the potential costs associated with breaking free from these lock-ins and the advantages and disadvantages of remaining within them.

aim for around 150-200 words in your answer and list sources used.


Task 1 answer:  

 

Technological lock-in: Continued use of a supposedly or possibly inferior technologies, even when more advanced technologies would be moderately easily available. 

Vendor lock-in: A situation where the customer has to use a product or service, and cannot easily change the product or service to another competitor etc. 

 

Possible costs of breaking free from a lock-in might include renewing a lot of in-use technology to make them compatible with another vendor.  

 

Some contracts might include clauses that prevent switching to another vendor, breaking free from the lock-in might require breaking the contract, and thus add expenses. 

 

Possible advantages:  

Staying in a lock-in situation can have some advantages. These advantages might include stability/consistency. If the original system is well established and works without any problems, it might be advantageous to refrain from changing it. 

Specific expertise, using the same system constantly allows the employees to become highly skilled in working with the system. Changing the said system will lower the skill level of employees, and if the change is not successful, the damage can be permanent. 

 

Possible disadvantages: 

Higher costs, once the lock-in has occurred, the vendor could raise the prices. 

Flexibility and innovation, if new technological advances or innovations are made, it might be impossible to evolve with the technological tide.

### Task2: Security Psychology

Familiarize yourself with definitions for following; cognitive-, behavioral- and social psychology, course material and search engines are your friends!
using one or multiple of them, explain your rationale for following phenomena:
- why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?
- why social engineering works on people?
- why many people have hard time using  passwords in secure way?
- why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?
- why it is so easy to spread malware?

no strict length requirements, but aim for 100+ words per question.


Task 2 Answers: 

Phishing attacks are effective because it takes advantage of human vulnerability. This might include even manipulation of emotions and cognitive biases. Exploiting human error is key with phishing attacks. The errors are artificially made by the hacker by manipulating human emotions, such as fear, urgency or curiosity. One simple example of fear/urgency manipulation is to alert the victim with an E-mail, which claims that the victim’s bank account will be closed without immediate action. 

 

Social engineering works because it preys on human psychology and exploiting emotions and social behaviors. The success of these attacks are reliant on the ability to manipulate emotions, and in many cases the user might be the weakest link in a security system. 

 

People have hard time with using passwords the secure way because a lot of reasons. People tend to use personal information as passwords, familiarity bias, these types of passwords are weak, because they are easy to crack for the possible hacker. Other reason is the power of habit. Some people might have a formula for making passwords, without realizing it themselves. Some people keep a physical note in their person to store their credentials, thus making that account vulnerable.  

 

PGP has too many vulnerabilities. PGP is vulnerable to an attack called “direct exfiltration”, where the attacker uses an old encrypted message to decrypt all of the messages to a server that the attacker controls. The other well-known vulnerability takes advantage of OpenPGP’s lack of mandatory integrity verification. Because there is not any integrity verification, the attacker can modify captured ciphertexts and capture the decrypted form of the message to a server that the attacker controls. 

 

Malware is moderately easy to spread, and hackers have a lot of tools to do so. These tools include technical vulnerabilities, human errors, social engineering, weak passwords and malicious websites. Usually the easiest way to spread malware is to exploit human weaknesses with manipulation.

## Task 3:

### Task3A: Intellectual Rights

Companies prioritize safeguarding their assets, encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects. This protection involves utilizing legal mechanisms like: 

- intellectual property (IP)
- copyright
- patent
- trademark
- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

along with employing technologies such as:

- watermarks
- software licenses
- digital rights management (DRM)
- software protection dongles

Please provide a brief explanation of each mentioned safeguarding method and cite any known use cases for each.

### Task3B: Freedom of Information

Other side of the coin, information wants to be free. Pick 2 safeguarding methods from previous part and Investigate and present real-world instances where the aforementioned safeguarding methods were bypassed, highlighting entities involved and the rationale behind their actions. Additionally, report on how they justify these circumventions. Answer in 400-500 word essay.
